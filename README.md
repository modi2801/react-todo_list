# Created a ToDo List WebApp using React js. and styling using Bootstrap.

In this project, i have created a simple react application in which i have created a to-do list using react js and bootstrap.
the code contains every detailed comments along with the code for the better understanding of the reader and tried to make UI and code as simple as possible.

The application will also receive the ToDo List created by user from the storage and render in the screen after reloading of the page too.

The About section of the page is created empty just to show the Routing process in React.

Hope You will Like it...

Happy Coding!!!
